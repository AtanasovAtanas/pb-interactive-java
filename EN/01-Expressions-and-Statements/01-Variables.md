Computers are machines that process data.

* Instructions and data are stored in the computer memory

* Data is stored by using variables

# Variables
A **Variable** is a container of information

* A named area of the computer memory 
* The data can be read and changed at any time

**Variables** provide means for:

* **Storing** information
* **Retrieving** stored info
* **Modifying** stored info

Variables are characterized by:

* **name** (identifier)
* **type** (of the information preserved)
* **value** (stored information)

Each of the variables in Java has a name, a type and a value. 

Here is how we would declare a variable and assign it with a value at the same time:

```java
int age = 25;
```
**Variable** is named area of the computer memory.

Stores a value from a particular data type.

Accessible in the program by its name.

Variables can be stored in the program's:
  * Operational memory - in the execution **stack**
  * Dynamic memory - in the **heap**
