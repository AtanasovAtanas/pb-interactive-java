# Statements
The **actions** that a program takes, are expressed as **statements**. 
Java supports several different kinds of statements and here are a few of them:
  * **Declaration statements** - used to declare local variables and constants
  * **Expression statements** - used to evaluate expressions
  * **Selection statements** - used to select one of a number of possible statements
  * **Iteration statements** - used to execute repeatedly an embedded statement
  * **Jump statements** - used to transfer control

Common statements (actions / commands) include:


* **Declaring** variables
```java
int counter;
```
* **Assigning** values
```java
counter = 1;
```
* Declaring and **initializing**
```java
int counter = 1;
```
**Printing** a value
```java
System.out.println(counter);
```
**Modifying** a value
```java
counter++;
sum = a + b;
```
