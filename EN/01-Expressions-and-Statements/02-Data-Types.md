# Data Types
Variables store value of a certain type 
* Number, letter, text (string), date, colour, picture, list…

Data types:
* **int** - an integer: 1, 2, 3…
* **double** - a floating-point number: -0.5, 3.14 …
* **boolean** - a boolean: true, false
* **char** - a symbol: 'a', 'b', '#'…
* **String** - text: "Hello", "World"…

Once a variable is defined, it can change its value many times, but 
it cannot change its data type later. Variables may hold only data 
of their type. Here is how we can declare variables of different types:
```java
int a = 5;
String text = "Some text";
char letter = 'A';
float f = 4.2;
```

Sets (ranges) of values with similar characteristics

Data types are characterized by:
* **Name**
    * Example: boolean, int, String
* **Size (memory usage)**
    * Example: 4 bytes
* **Default value**
    * Example: 0

# Naming Conventions
In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the name to be used for variables

In Java the convention for naming variables is **"camelCase"**:
* First word begins with a **lowercase letter**, all the rest with **capital letters**

```java
thisIsCorrect
this_Is_Not_Correct
ThisIsNotCorrect
This_is_also_not_correct
```

There are other conventions such as:
* Pascal Case - capitalizes each word:
```java
class MountainBike
```

* Upper Case with underscores:
```java
const int INITIAL_VALUE = 5;
```
