# Java Language
# Programming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters
The **programming language** defines a set of rules (syntax)

Languages are either **compiled** (like Java, C#, C++) or **interpreted** (like JavaScript and Python)

The **compiler** translates programming code to **machine code**

* During the compilation, it finds syntax errors

The **interpreter** executes the code line by line

* It finds syntax errors at runtime

# The Java Language
**Java** is modern, general purpose programming language

* Used for creating Web apps, mobile apps, games, back-end apps

**Object-oriented**

* **Java** programs consists of classes, which hold **methods**

Good choice for **beginners**

* Easy syntax, easy to read, **easy to learn**
* Big developer **community**, many jobs
* Lots of **resources**: books, lessons, courses

# Java Compilation and Execution
Java is a **high-level language**, which is **compiled**

A program in Java is written in text format (**source code**)

The **class files** generated by the compiler are independent of the machine or the OS

* Can run on **any** system, e.g. compile in Windows, run in Linux

# JDK and JRE
JDK – Java Development Toolkit

* Java software development kit (Java SDK) – toolset for developers
* Includes a **virtual machine** (JVM), a **Java compiler** (javac) and other developer tools
* JDK is available for free download from Oracle: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/

JDK should not be confused for a runtime environment (JRE)

* JRE allow to **run** Java programs, but can't **develop own programs**
