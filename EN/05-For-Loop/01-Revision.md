# Nested Conditions
An **if...else** statement can exist within another **if...else** statement

Generally used when we have to test one condition followed by another

```java
if (expression) {
  if (nested expression)
    // Code to be executed
  else
    // Code to be executed
}
```

# Conditional Operators
Logical operators are used to perform logical operation such as **AND**, **OR**

The logical operators are:
* AND (**&&**)
* OR (**\| \|**)
* Logical negation (**!**)

# Switch-case
Used for choosing among a list of possibilities
Alternative to an **if-else** statement

```java
switch (selector) {
  case someCase:
    statements;
    break;
  default:
    statements;
    break;
}
```
